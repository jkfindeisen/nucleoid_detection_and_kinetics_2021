function example_colocalize_DNA_EdU_spots()
% This script examplarily shows the combination of the fitted DNA and EdU
% spot detection to determine how many nucleoids were EdU-positive, i.e.
% how many of the detected DNA spots also had an EdU spot close by. The
% decision is done by matching DNA and EdU spot pairs and then choosing all
% pairs that have a mutual distance below a certain threshold.
%
% Requires that the nucleoids are determined before.
%
% Part of "The TFAM to mtDNA ratio defines inner-cellular nucleoid
% populations with distinct activity levels"
